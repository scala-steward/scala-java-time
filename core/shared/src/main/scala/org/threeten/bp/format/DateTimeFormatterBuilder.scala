   * The value will be zero-padded on the left. If the size of the value means that it cannot be
   * printed within the width then an exception is thrown. If the value of the field is negative
   * then an exception is thrown during printing.
   *
   * This method supports a special technique of parsing known as 'adjacent value parsing'. This
   * technique solves the problem where a variable length value is followed by one or more fixed
   * length values. The standard parser is greedy, and thus it would normally steal the digits that
   * are needed by the fixed width value parsers that follow the variable width one.
   *
   * No action is required to initiate 'adjacent value parsing'. When a call to {@code appendValue}
   * with a variable width is made, the builder enters adjacent value parsing setup mode. If the
   * immediately subsequent method call or calls on the same builder are to this method, then the
   * parser will reserve space so that the fixed width values can be parsed.
   *
   * For example, consider {@code builder.appendValue(YEAR).appendValue(MONTH_OF_YEAR, 2);} The year
   * is a variable width parse of between 1 and 19 digits. The month is a fixed width parse of 2
   * digits. Because these were appended to the same builder immediately after one another, the year
   * parser will reserve two digits for the month to parse. Thus, the text '201106' will correctly
   * parse to a year of 2011 and a month of 6. Without adjacent value parsing, the year would
   * greedily parse all six digits and leave nothing for the month.
   *
   * Adjacent value parsing applies to each set of fixed width not-negative values in the parser
   * that immediately follow any kind of variable width value. Calling any other append method will
   * end the setup of adjacent value parsing. Thus, in the unlikely event that you need to avoid
   * adjacent value parsing behavior, simply add the {@code appendValue} to another {@code
   * DateTimeFormatterBuilder. and add that to this builder.
   *
   * If adjacent parsing is active, then parsing must match exactly the specified number of digits
   * in both strict and lenient modes. In addition, no positive or negative sign is permitted.

   * The count of pattern letters determine the format.
   *
   * <b>Text</b>: The text style is determined based on the number of pattern letters used. Less
   * than 4 pattern letters will use the {@link TextStyle#SHORT short form}. Exactly 4 pattern
   * letters will use the {@link TextStyle#FULL full form}. Exactly 5 pattern letters will use the
   * {@link TextStyle#NARROW narrow form}.
   *
   * <b>Number</b>: If the count of letters is one, then the value is printed using the minimum
   * number of digits and without padding as per {@link #appendValue(TemporalField)}. Otherwise, the
   * count of digits is used as the width of the output field as per {@link
   * #appendValue(TemporalField, int)}.
   *
   * <b>Number/Text</b>: If the count of pattern letters is 3 or greater, use the Text rules above.
   * Otherwise use the Number rules above.
   *
   * <b>Fraction</b>: Outputs the nano-of-second field as a fraction-of-second. The nano-of-second
   * value has nine digits, thus the count of pattern letters is from 1 to 9. If it is less than 9,
   * then the nano-of-second value is truncated, with only the most significant digits being output.
   * When parsing in strict mode, the number of parsed digits must match the count of pattern
   * letters. When parsing in lenient mode, the number of parsed digits must be at least the count
   * of pattern letters, up to 9 digits.
   *
   * <b>Year</b>: The count of letters determines the minimum field width below which padding is
   * used. If the count of letters is two, then a {@link #appendValueReduced reduced} two digit form
   * is used. For printing, this outputs the rightmost two digits. For parsing, this will parse
   * using the base value of 2000, resulting in a year within the range 2000 to 2099 inclusive. If
   * the count of letters is less than four (but not two), then the sign is only output for negative
   * years as per {@link SignStyle#NORMAL}. Otherwise, the sign is output if the pad width is
   * exceeded, as per {@link SignStyle#EXCEEDS_PAD}
   *
   * <b>ZoneId</b>: This outputs the time-zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'. If the count of letters
   * is two, then the time-zone ID is output. Any other count of letters throws {@code
   * IllegalArgumentException}. <pre> Pattern Equivalent builder methods VV appendZoneId() </pre>
   *
   * <b>Zone names</b>: This outputs the display name of the time-zone ID. If the count of letters
   * is one, two or three, then the short name is output. If the count of letters is four, then the
   * full name is output. Five or more letters throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}. <pre>
   * Pattern Equivalent builder methods z appendZoneText(TextStyle.SHORT) zz
   * appendZoneText(TextStyle.SHORT) zzz appendZoneText(TextStyle.SHORT) zzzz
   * appendZoneText(TextStyle.FULL) </pre>
   *
   * <b>Offset X and x</b>: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern letters. One
   * letter outputs just the hour', such as '+01', unless the minute is non-zero in which case the
   * minute is also output, such as '+0130'. Two letters outputs the hour and minute, without a
   * colon, such as '+0130'. Three letters outputs the hour and minute, with a colon, such as
   * '+01:30'. Four letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, without a colon, such
   * as '+013015'. Five letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, with a colon, such
   * as '+01:30:15'. Six or more letters throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}. Pattern letter 'X'
   * (upper case) will output 'Z' when the offset to be output would be zero, whereas pattern letter
   * 'x' (lower case) will output '+00', '+0000', or '+00:00'. <pre> Pattern Equivalent builder
   * methods X appendOffset("+HHmm","Z") XX appendOffset("+HHMM","Z") XXX appendOffset("+HH:MM","Z")
   * XXXX appendOffset("+HHMMss","Z") XXXXX appendOffset("+HH:MM:ss","Z") x
   * appendOffset("+HHmm","+00") xx appendOffset("+HHMM","+0000") xxx
   * appendOffset("+HH:MM","+00:00") xxxx appendOffset("+HHMMss","+0000") xxxxx
   * appendOffset("+HH:MM:ss","+00:00") </pre>
   *
   * <b>Offset Z</b>: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern letters. One, two or
   * three letters outputs the hour and minute, without a colon, such as '+0130'. Four or more
   * letters throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}. The output will be '+0000' when the offset is
   * zero. <pre> Pattern Equivalent builder methods Z appendOffset("+HHMM","+0000") ZZ
   * appendOffset("+HHMM","+0000") ZZZ appendOffset("+HHMM","+0000") </pre>
   *
   * <b>Optional section</b>: The optional section markers work exactly like calling {@link
   * #optionalStart()} and {@link #optionalEnd()}.
   *
   * <b>Pad modifier</b>: Modifies the pattern that immediately follows to be padded with spaces.
   * The pad width is determined by the number of pattern letters. This is the same as calling
   * {@link #padNext(int)}.
   *
   * For example, 'ppH' outputs the hour-of-day padded on the left with spaces to a width of 2.
   *
   * Any unrecognized letter is an error. Any non-letter character, other than '[', ']', '{', '}'
   * and the single quote will be output directly. Despite this, it is recommended to use single
   * quotes around all characters that you want to output directly to ensure that future changes do
   * not break your application.
   *
   * Note that the pattern string is similar, but not identical, to {@link
   * java.text.SimpleDateFormat SimpleDateFormat}. The pattern string is also similar, but not
   * identical, to that defined by the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR/LDML). Pattern
   * letters 'E' and 'u' are merged, which changes the meaning of "E" and "EE" to be numeric.
   * Pattern letters 'X' is aligned with Unicode CLDR/LDML, which affects pattern 'X'. Pattern
   * letter 'y' and 'Y' parse years of two digits and more than 4 digits differently. Pattern
   * letters 'n', 'A', 'N', 'I' and 'p' are added. Number types will reject large numbers.
   *
   * @param pattern
   *   the pattern to add, not null
   * @return
   *   this, for chaining, not null
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException
   *   if the pattern is invalid
